//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Second step, gathering all the specific details required for a new system"

const design = "During this phase, it is necessary precursor to the main developer stage. The overall system architecture is designed by defining the functionality of each midle as well ass their interaction with third-party modules."

const implementation = "This stage is where developers write code and build application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications."

const testingAndIntegration = "Stage where developers test their code to make sure that theree arent any bug and that the end-user experience will not negatively be affected at any point."

const maintain = "When software reaches market, developers must move into a maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities required to handle issue reeorted by end-users. "
